The Digital Utopia Project (aka the Project)
=============

Reimagining Work for a Better Tomorrow


<b>COMMONALITIES</b><br>
To get the most out of being involved in the Project, it is important to have a common vision, since one aspect of the project relates to working on something you are really passionate about.

<b>TECHNICAL</b><br>
The first technological solution we need to solve is building a backbone that will support the initiative.  


<b>PHYSICAL</b><br>
A physical space will solve the part of the initiative relating to fostering face-to-face human connections. Even though technological relations  has grown more rampant over the years.

The physical Center can also provide a revenue stream to allow the Project to be funded without venture capital.
