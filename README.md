<h2>The Digital Utopia Project</h2>

Reimagining Work for a Better Tomorrow


:: This text is a work in progress ::

<b>PRINCIPLES</b><br>
To get the most out of being involved in the Project, it is important to have a common vision, since one aspect of the project relates to working on something you are really passionate about.
<br>
1. Free and voluntary membership<br>
2. Democratic Control among members<br>
3. Economic participation of the members<br>
4. Autonomy and independency<br>
5. Education, entertainment and information<br>
6. Cooperation among Cooperatives<br>
7. Commitment to the community<br>

<b>TECHNICAL</b><br>
The first technological solution we need to solve is building a <b>Skeleton</b> that will support the initiative.  


<b>PHYSICAL</b><br>
A physical Center will solve the part of the initiative relating to fostering face-to-face human connections. Even though technological relations have grown more rampant over the years.

The physical Center can provide a revenue stream to allow the Project to be funded without venture capital.
